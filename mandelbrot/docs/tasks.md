# Mandelbrot Visualization Project - Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of tasks for improving the Mandelbrot visualization project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Code Organization and Architecture

1. [ ] Refactor the project to use a more modular architecture (e.g., MVC or component-based)
2. [ ] Create a dedicated configuration module for managing application settings
3. [ ] Extract the Mandelbrot calculation logic into a separate service that can be shared between renderers
4. [ ] Implement a proper state management solution instead of using global variables
5. [ ] Create interfaces for all major components to improve code clarity and maintainability
6. [ ] Remove the @ts-ignore comment in mandelbrot-cpu.ts and fix the underlying issue
7. [ ] Standardize error handling throughout the application
8. [ ] Implement proper dependency injection for better testability

## Performance Optimizations

9. [ ] Optimize the CPU renderer with Web Workers for parallel computation
10. [ ] Implement adaptive iteration depth based on zoom level
11. [ ] Add support for progressive rendering to improve responsiveness
12. [ ] Optimize the WebGL shader to use early termination for points outside the set
13. [ ] Implement a caching mechanism for previously calculated regions
14. [ ] Fix the hard-coded loop limit (10000) in the WebGL fragment shader
15. [ ] Optimize matrix transformations by combining operations where possible
16. [ ] Add support for different precision modes (float/double) for deep zooming

## Testing and Quality Assurance

17. [ ] Increase unit test coverage for all components (currently only linear-algebra.ts is tested)
18. [ ] Add integration tests for the renderers
19. [ ] Implement visual regression testing for the Mandelbrot visualization
20. [ ] Add performance benchmarks to track rendering speed improvements
21. [ ] Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically
22. [ ] Add input validation for all user inputs
23. [ ] Implement error boundaries to prevent application crashes
24. [ ] Create a test suite for the color mapping functionality

## Documentation

25. [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation for all classes and methods
26. [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all functions and classes
27. [ ] Create a user guide explaining how to use the application
28. [ ] Document the mathematical principles behind the Mandelbrot set visualization
29. [ ] Add inline comments explaining complex algorithms and calculations
30. [ ] Create architecture diagrams showing the relationships between components
31. [ ] Document the color mapping algorithm and how it can be customized
32. [ ] Create a contributing guide for new developers

## Build Process and DevOps

33. [ ] Update dependencies to their latest versions
34. [ ] Configure proper source maps for production builds for easier debugging
35. [ ] Set up automated deployment to GitHub Pages or similar hosting
36. [ ] Implement code splitting to reduce initial load time
37. [ ] Add bundle analysis to optimize bundle size
38. [ ] Configure proper TypeScript strict mode settings (some are commented out)
39. [ ] Set up linting with ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style
40. [ ] Implement versioning and changelog generation

## UI/UX Improvements

41. [ ] Replace table-based layout with modern CSS (Flexbox/Grid)
42. [ ] Add responsive design to support different screen sizes
43. [ ] Implement touch support for mobile devices
44. [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
45. [ ] Create a more intuitive UI for parameter adjustments
46. [ ] Add a color palette selector for different visualization styles
47. [ ] Implement a fullscreen mode for better viewing experience
48. [ ] Add a loading indicator during computation
49. [ ] Implement a history feature to save and restore interesting locations
50. [ ] Add a screenshot/export feature to save visualizations

## Feature Enhancements

51. [ ] Add support for other fractals (Julia set, Burning Ship, etc.)
52. [ ] Implement a 3D visualization mode
53. [ ] Add animation capabilities to create zoom/rotation videos
54. [ ] Implement a sharing feature to generate shareable URLs
55. [ ] Add support for custom color gradients
56. [ ] Implement a mini-map for navigation
57. [ ] Add statistical information about the current view (e.g., area covered)
58. [ ] Create a gallery of interesting locations in the Mandelbrot set
59. [ ] Add support for high-DPI displays
60. [ ] Implement GPU-accelerated computation for other browsers/devices

## Accessibility and Internationalization

61. [ ] Add proper ARIA attributes for accessibility
62. [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation works for all features
63. [ ] Add support for screen readers
64. [ ] Implement internationalization (i18n) for UI text
65. [ ] Add high-contrast mode for better visibility
66. [ ] Ensure color blind friendly visualization options
67. [ ] Add text descriptions of the visualization for non-visual users
68. [ ] Test and fix accessibility issues with automated tools
