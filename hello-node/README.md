# hello-node

This is me following the excellent Udemy course
[NodeJS - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide)
by Max Scharzmueller.

I'm foolishly attempting to do it in TypeScript rather than JavaScript (having done Max's
TypeScript course a while back), which causes the code to differ slightly from the course
but it's going alright so far.

Not sure what I'm going to use Node for (that I wouldn't just use HTTP4K, or Compojure,
or even Django...) but I want to know how to use Node to solve real problems, given that
world+dog appears to be using it these days.
