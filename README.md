# Understanding TypeScript

This is the code that I'm writing as I go through Maximilian Schwarzmueller's
wonderful Udemy course
[Understanding TypeScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/). 

I'm finding TypeScript to be a really fun language so far and I hope I get the
chance to use it for something real.
